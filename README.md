# Reading Groups
==============

This repository hosts a list of research papers and new topics discussed in weekly discussions of our group. We believe that reading 
research papers not only strengthens our concepts, but also helps in understanding the intuition behind the 
development of a particular idea, and the complete thought process of the author. The Repo contains the detailed summary and Implementation of the research paper.

A collection of concise write-ups on each paper, with something noteworthy is also maintained here.
