Papers we Read
==============

This repository hosts a list of research papers discussed in weekly meetings 
of our group. We believe that reading research papers not only strengthens 
our concepts, but also helps in understanding the intuition behind the 
development of a particular idea, and the complete thought process of the 
author.

A collection of concise write-ups on each paper, with something noteworthy is 
also maintained here.
