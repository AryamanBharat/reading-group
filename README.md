Papers we Read
==============

This repository hosts a list of research papers discussed in weekly meetings of our group. We believe that reading 
research papers not only strengthens our concepts, but also helps in understanding the intuition behind the 
development of a particular idea, and the complete thought process of the author.

A collection of concise write-ups on each paper, with something noteworthy is also maintained here.
